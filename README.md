# cs221_github_project
# RULES OF THE GITHUB PROJECT:
# 1. Please do not work in any of the public folders, (IE only work in your designated folder which I (David) have made for you). We can try to work on master as a team, but in order for this to work, you MUST only edit files in your own folder! When we are all ready to have something in the common folder, we will agree on it and make sure no conflicts exist.
# 2. Pretty much it. Don't put things that are too larger for github (IE data dumps, html scrapes, etc).
